## Project Description
This project is a terminal-based calculator developed as part of a programming fundamentals exercise.

The application allows a user to:

- Perform basic calculations
- Clear the screen/output
- Prevent invalid input
- Prevent division by zero
- Continuously run until the user chooses to exit

The goal of the project is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Functions
- Sentinel loops
- Input validation
- Exception handling
- Modular programming

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|------|------|
| Addition | Adds two numbers |
| Subtraction | Subtracts numbers |
| Multiplication | Multiplies numbers |
| Division | Handles divide-by-zero safely |
| Clear Screen | Removes previous output from terminal |
| Continuous Loop | Runs until user exits |
| Input Validation | Prevents invalid numeric input |

## Program Behaviour

The program repeatedly asks the user to select an operation:

| Key | Action |
|----|------|
| + | addition |
| - | subtraction |
| * | multiplication |
| / | division |
| c | clear screen |
| q | quit program |
